# Forms

In the last couple of chapters, we have coverd HTML and Flask Templates. These allow us to create user interfaces, or web pages at least, that are rendered by the web browser into something that looks a little better than just simple strings of text. These imagine the user as a consumer of content, but we want to do more than this. For our user interface or our frontend, we really want the user to be able to interact with our application. As with any user-facing program, interaction is about allowing the user to provide some sort of input, performing an action, and returning some sort of output that responds to that input. When you post on social media, for instance, you are providing input (text or a picture), which is sent to the application server. That input is then added to the stream or your wall or wherever that particular social media application shares the input. On Facebook, users input text and images in a form on the main application. That is then posted to the user's "wall." The main way that web applications receive data is through forms that are included in the user interface. 

## CRUD

Many websites allow users to add content. Anything from a blogging platform to social media and so on. These websites frequently follow the CRUD design pattern, which stands for "Create," "Read," "Update," and "Delete." Each of these represents a function that a user can perform. The Create functionality allows users to create some content that is saved by the website, probably in a database. The Read functionality allows the user to retrieve a specific bit of content from the website. The Update functionality allows the user to change something about content they have already added (e.g. when you edit a post on Facebook that has already been posted). Finally, the Delete functionality allows the user to remove content from the website. Usually the site will have some access control throught authentication to prevent unauthorized users from altering or deleting (or even creating) data that is saved by the application.

If an application allows the users to add content then their will be a couple of components that are necessary to the application that are not built into Flask by default. First is Forms and the second is databases or data storage technologies. Forms are HTML elements that give the user specific types of fields to provide input. Databases are storage technologies that organize and store content that has been submitted to the application. 

## HTML Forms

HTML forms are rendered by the browser to give the user a place to input data. At its most basic, an HTML form is comprised of three types of tags: ```<form>```, ```<input>```, and ```<label>``` tags. The first is a block level element, meaning it defines a block of space on the screen that spans form left to right margin of its container. The next two are inline elements that give the user a field to input data and a label to help screenreaders identify a particular input. Here is a basic example and the html code.

```html
<form action="/login" method="post">
   <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
   <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
   <label for="password">Password:</label><br>
   <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br>
   <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
```

<form>
   <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
   <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
   <label for="password">Password:</label><br>
   <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br>
   <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form><br>

There are plenty of excellent tutorials on HTML that will help you learn about all of the features of HTML forms, and so I am not going to repeat that here. In short, the form, when submitted, will send whatever data is in the input fields (keyed to the input name) to the action (another route) via the POST method. It is entirely possible for us to create forms in our templates when we use Flask. However, you'll see as we go through Flask that it is sometimes better to use a library rather than building something from scratch. This is because, first, we don't want to reinvent the wheel. Second, if the library is well maintained and has been around for a bit, it will probably be a bit more reliable than what we could build ourselves because it has had many eyes looking at it and debugging it. 

Beyond the concern of repeating code that already works just fine, dealing with forms, and really accepting any user input, can pose security concerns. In the early days of dynamic websites, it was possible, for example, to send a SQL statement that either returned the entire contents of a database or even deleted the entire contents of a database through a webform. If the developer didn't include a bunch of processing to prevent it, those commands would be executed. When we use libraries to manage our forms for us, we can feel pretty confident (especially if we've read the documentation and the code) that the libraries are dealing with those security concerns for us behind the scenes. That is the case with Flask-WTF.

## Enter WTForms and Flask-WTF

Instead of writing our forms in our templates, we wil be using [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to help us build forms. I encourage you to take a moment and read the documentation. Instead of us building the forms in HTML, we add a form to our application we create a Form class that will then be rendered into our template at runtime. To get started with Flask-WTF and our forms, I want to create a new test that will at least check to see that my form is being rendered. 

_blog_tests.py_
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import unittest
from app import app


class TestBlog(unittest.TestCase):

   def setUp(self):
      self.client = app.test_client()

   def test_home_page_returns(self):
      resp = self.client.get('/')
      self.assertEqual(200, resp.status_code)
   
   def test_home_page_returns_correct_html(self):
      resp = self.client.get('/')
      html = resp.data.decode('utf-8')
      self.assertTrue(html.startswith('<!DOCTYPE html>'))
      self.assertIn('<title>Fancy-Pants Blog</title>', html)
      self.assertTrue(html.endswith('</html>'))

   def test_menu_text(self):
      resp = self.client.get('/')
      html = resp.data.decode('utf-8')
      soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
      menu = [link.get_text() for link in soup.select('.menu-item')]
      self.assertListEqual(['About', 'CV', 'Blog'], menu)

      heading = soup.h1.get_text()
      self.assertEqual(heading, 'Blog Posts')

   def test_blog_post(self):
      resp = self.client.get('/blog')
      html = resp.data.decode('utf-8')
      soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
      head = soup.h1.get_text()
      self.assertEqual('Hello Dylan', head)
   
   def test_form(self):
      resp = self.client.get('/post')
      html = resp.data.decode('utf-8')
      self.assertIn('<form method="post">', html)
      self.assertIn('</form>', html)
   
   def test_form_fields(self):
      resp = self.client.get('/post')
      html = resp.data.decode('utf-8')
      soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
      fields = [i.attrs['name'] for i in soup.find_all('input')]
      self.assertListEqual(fields[1:], ['post_title', 'author', 'submit'])
      self.assertEqual(soup.textarea.attrs['name'], 'text')
```

1. test_form() This test checks to make sure that the opening and closing form tags are present in the response. This is a pretty simple test.

2. test_form_fields() I also want to test that my form has the expected fields. I am testing by name because that will also ensure that they are valid fields. 

I run those tests, and of course they are failing as to be expected:

```

```

Now we need to do some setup. First we will need to install Flask-WTF and create a file where our forms will live.

```
(env) ~/Projects/blog$ pip install Flask-WTF
(env) ~/Projects/blog$ touch app/forms.py
```

Now we'll create our first form. This form will accept a title, an author name, and a text area in which the user could enter a blog post. 

_forms.py_
```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, TextAreaField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired

class NewEntryForm(FlaskForm):
   post_title = StringField('Title', validators=[DataRequired()])
   author = StringField('Author', validators=[DataRequired()])
   text = TextAreaField('Text', validators=[DataRequired()])
   submit = SubmitField('Submit')
```

1. **import statments** You'll notice that we are importing a bunch of different things from flask_wtf and wtforms. The FlaskForm is a class that we will be extending. It is a wrapper that allows Flask to use WTForms easily. Second, there are imports from wtforms that include the field classes and the validators for those fields. When we instantiate each of this, we create a field that will be rendered into an HTML input.

2. **class NewEntryForm(FlaskForm)** This is how we extend a class in Python. Our NewEntryForm class gains all of the methods and properties of the FlaskForm. 

3. **The Fields** Each of these fields (title, author, text, submit) are instances of classes from wtforms. They have a corresponding input type in HTML. The first parameter is the label for the field, which helps screen readers. The validators are automatically run. This one checks to make sure that the user has entered data or the form won't submit. 

Our next step is to add our forms to our application and add some configuration to our application. 

_\_\_init\_\_.py_
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
from .forms import NewEntryForm

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'us@randomStrin1her0'

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/<name>')
def index(name = None):
   data = {
      'title': 'Fancy-Pants Blog',
      'menu': [
         {
            'link': 'about',
            'text': 'About'
         },
         {
            'link' : 'cv',
            'text': 'CV'
         }, 
         {
            'link' : 'blog',
            'text' : 'Blog'
         }
      ]
   }
   return render_template('index.html', data=data, name=name)


@app.route('/blog')
def blog():
   data = {
      "title": "Fancy-Pants Blog",
      "menu": [
         {
            "link": "about",
            "text": "About"
         },
         {
            "link": "blog",
            "text": "Blog"
         }
      ],
      "posts": [
         {
            "title": "Post One",
            "author": "Jimmy",
            "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolor doloremque totam adipisci ex dolores vitae enim soluta quo provident! Voluptatem tenetur harum magni pariatur. Aliquid laborum dolores harum dignissimos quibusdam!"
         },
         {
            "title": "About Chickens",
            "author": "Jimmy",
            "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolor doloremque totam adipisci ex dolores vitae enim soluta quo provident! Voluptatem tenetur harum magni pariatur. Aliquid laborum dolores harum dignissimos quibusdam!"
         },
         {
            "title": "Trampled by Turtles",
            "author": "Jimmy",
            "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolor doloremque totam adipisci ex dolores vitae enim soluta quo provident! Voluptatem tenetur harum magni pariatur. Aliquid laborum dolores harum dignissimos quibusdam!"
         }
      ]
   }
   return render_template('blog.html', data=data)

@app.route('/post', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def new_post():
   data = {
      'title': 'Blog',
      'post_title': None,
      'author': None,
      'text': None
   }

   form = NewEntryForm()

   if form.validate_on_submit():
      data['post_title'] = form.data.title 
      data['author'] = form.data.author 
      data['text'] = form.data.text 
      form.data.title = ''
      form.data.author = ''
      form.data.text = ''

   return render_template('post.html', form=form, data=data)
```

First, we imported our form and then we configured our app to have a secret key. We also added the ```new_post()``` method to our flask app. A couple things to notice about this:

1. The route includes a method parameter. The method of all routes by default is GET. If we want a route to accept POST requests, then we need to specify that that is an allowed method. This route accepts both GET and POST requests. If the request is GET, it returns the form and any data. If it is post, it validates the form and would add that data to a database if we had one set up yet.

2. You'll see that our render_template recieves an extra parameter: form. The template will have both data and a form. We'll add that next. 

3. The form.data property is the property that contains all of the values returned by the form when the user POSTS. The values are stored as key-value pairs by the "name" attribute of the ```<input>``` field. So ```form.data.title``` will get us the value submited in the ```<input type='text' name='title'>``` field. 

One more piece to add. We need to add to our template so that that form is rendered. I also need to actually create the template. So first, I create the file post.html in my templates directory.

_post.html_
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}
{% if data.post_title %}
<div>
   <h2>{{ data.post_title }}</h2>
   <h3>{{ data.author }}</h3>
   <p>{{ data.text }}</p>
</div>
{% endif %}
<form method="post">
   {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
   {{ form.post_title.label }} {{ form.post_title() }}
   {{ form.author.label }} {{ form.author() }}
   {{ form.text.label }} {{ form.text() }}
   {{ form.submit.label }} {{ form.submit() }}
</form>
{% end block %}
```

You'll notice that we're including all of the properties of our form that we defined in our _forms.py_ file and instantiated our ```new_post()``` method. You'll notice taht we are including both the label and the field itself and the field itself is a function call (which creates the input field). You'll also see we added a hidden_tag which helps prevent cross-site forgery--or it ensures that the data is coming from _this_ form and not a form created by someone trying to exploit my website. 

Now when we run our tests, we see that we get all of them to pass:

```
(env) ~/Projects/blog$ python -m unittest tests/blog_tests.py 
........
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 8 tests in 0.021s

OK
```

There is one issue with this. My unittests pass, but when I launch my Flask server and try to run this application and submit some data through my forms, which for now should just get added to the page, I run into a 500 server error. When this happens, I go to my terminal that is running Flask and I get this error message:

```

```

The last few lines are important, and they are telling me that for some reason my form.data has no attribute 'post_title'. After a bit of scrutiny, I found the problem is located in how I access form data. We used to be able to get that data using dot notation. So to get the value from the post_title field of the form, I used to be able to write ```form.data.post_title```, but that doesn't work anymore. Instead, I have to access it using the dictionary key: ```form.data['post_title']```, so that means I need to change up my new_post() method:

_\_\_init\_\_.py_

         }
      ]
   }
   return render_template('index.html', data=data, name=name)


@app.route('/blog')
def blog():
   data = {

         }
      ]
   }
   return render_template('blog.html', data=data)


@app.route('/post', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def new_post():
   data = {
      'title': 'Blog',
      'post_title': None,
      'author': None,
      'text': None
   }

   form = NewEntryForm()

   if form.validate_on_submit():
      data['post_title'] = form.data['post_title']
      data['author'] = form.data['author']
      data['text'] = form.data['text']
      form.data['post_title'] = ''
      form.data['author'] = ''
      form.data['text'] = ''

   return render_template('post.html', form=form, data=data)
```

Now when I run my tests and when I manually test out the form, everything works fine. In the next section, we'll learn how to take that form data and store it to a database rather than simply adding it to a page.
