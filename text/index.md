# TDD in Flask

This book is a supplement to [Test-Driven Development with Python: Obey the Testing Goat: Using Django, Selenium, and Javascript](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/). In this version, much of the content is not copied over. Instead this provides modified exercises and examples using Flask instead of Django. If you have a bit more experience with Python or want to use a more robust framework, I encourage you to take a look at Percival's book. If you want to learn about test-driven development but find Flask suits your purposes better, this is a supplement for you. This book is being built for a course offered at Seattle University, and therefore will contain some additional content for that course. In the future, perhaps video lectures and exercises will become available. 

For the exercises, starter-code is available. Please feel free to [clone it here](https://github.com/dlondonmedina/FlaskTDD-sc.git).

## About the Author

I direct the Web, Application, and Technology Studies program at Seattle University’s School of New and Continuing Studies. My research and pedagogy are deeply invested learning and its application to future contexts. My MA and PhD research focuses on how students acquire and deploy rhetorical strategies and skills within the social, material, and technological landscapes in which they work. I teach in the areas of social theory, social science research, writing, web development, and Python.

At heart, I am a maker and have devoted a great deal of energy to creating projects and programs to address problems I see in the world around me. This lead me to develop a transition workshop for service members, which I taught for four years at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. I also lead a team developing Cluster—a suite of tools that work like a personal writing trainer. In the summer, I teach a Python camp for underrepresented kids.
