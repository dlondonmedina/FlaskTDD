# Finishing our Blog

In Chapter 14, I set up a bunch of tests for my identity management system, and for my blog. In Chapter 15, I got the identity management system working, and now I'm ready to get the blog working with the database. I went in this order because I want to control who can post to the blog. Basically, if a user can register, they'll be able to post. Let's take a look at those tests again:

_blog_tests.py_
```python
...

   ##########################
   ####    Blog Tests    ####

   def test_blog_not_logged_in(self):
      resp = self.client.post('/post', data=dict(title="bad", slug="bad", text="bad"), follow_redirects=True)
      self.assertIn(b'You must be logged in', resp.data)
   
   def test_blog_logged_in(self):
      self.login('author@example.com', 'password')
      data = {
         'post_title': 'Test Post',
         'slug': 'Short summary of the post.',
         'text': '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer bibendum enim id enim tempor, ullamcorper tempor quam tincidunt. Proin eget dapibus arcu. Donec ornare feugiat elit, eu efficitur nisi dictum in. Donec libero nisl, pretium eget placerat nec, tincidunt varius orci. Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus. Nunc consequat leo enim, ut maximus neque pellentesque ac. Quisque porta, justo in maximus tincidunt, eros arcu tempus elit, a tristique turpis quam vel lacus.

Etiam nulla dolor, tincidunt a nisl in, porta efficitur felis. Donec pretium lobortis facilisis. '''
      }
      resp = self.client.post('/post', data=data, follow_redirects=True)
      self.assertIn(b'Test Post', resp.data)

   def test_get_all_posts(self):
      self.login('author@example.com', 'Password')
      resp = self.client.get('/blog')
      self.assertIn(b'Title', resp.data)
      self.assertIn(b'Title2', resp.data)

   def test_get_one_post(self):
      resp = self.client.get('/blog/1')
      self.assertIn(b'Title', resp.data)
      self.assertNotIn(b'Title2', resp.data)

...
```

1. ```test_blog_not_logged_in``` This method tries to make a post without logging in first. This will fail. The parameter ```follow_redirects``` tells the post method to follow any redirects that might be sent back from the test_client. If we were looking at this manually, the app would redirect us to the index page flashing the message "You must be logged in".

2. ```test_blog_logged_in``` This method logs in first and tries to make a post. The app redirects us to the blog page after a successful post, so the test makes sure that post I added is actually on the page. 

3. ```test_get_all_posts``` and ```test_get_one_post``` tell us that we must two routes for blog. One that gets all the posts and one that gets a single post by id. I'm testing the posts that I added to the database on setup.

Okay, so now I need to modify my Blog form a little bit. Instead of having an author field, I want to get the author from the authentication data. Then, I want to add a slug or tag line field. 

_forms.py_
```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, TextAreaField, PasswordField, BooleanField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import ValidationError, DataRequired, Email, EqualTo
from app.models import User

class NewEntryForm(FlaskForm):
   post_title = StringField('Title', validators=[DataRequired()])
   slug = StringField('Tagline', validators=[DataRequired()])
   text = TextAreaField('Text', validators=[DataRequired()])
   submit = SubmitField('Submit')


class LoginForm(FlaskForm):
   email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired()])
   password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[DataRequired()])
   remember_me = BooleanField('Remember Me')
   submit = SubmitField('Sign In')


class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm):
   username = StringField('Username', validators=[DataRequired()])
   email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])
   first = StringField('First Name', validators=[DataRequired()])
   last = StringField('Last Name', validators=[DataRequired()])
   password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[DataRequired()])
   password2 = PasswordField('Repeat Password', validators=[DataRequired(), EqualTo('password')])
   submit = SubmitField('Register!')

   def validate_username(self, username):
      user = User.query.filter_by(username=username.data).first()
      if user is not None:
         raise ValidationError('User already exists.')

   def validate_email(self, email):
      user = User.query.filter_by(email=email.data).first()
      if user is not None:
         raise ValidationError('User already exists.')
```
At this point you should feel more comfortable reading the code, so I'm intentionally not going to give you a lot of detailed explanation on the forms. Pay attention to the changes I mentioned above.

Next, we need to check that our Model still looks good, which it does:

_models.py_
```python
from . import db 
from flask_login import UserMixin
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from app import login

class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
   id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
   username = db.Column(db.String(40), index=True, unique=True, nullable=False)
   email = db.Column(db.String(120), index=True, unique=True, nullable=False)
   first_name = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
   last_name = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
   password = db.Column(db.String(200))
   joined = db.Column(db.DateTime, index=True, default=datetime.now(timezone.utc))
   posts = db.relationship('Post', backref='author_posts', lazy='dynamic')

   def hash_password(self, password):
      self.password = generate_password_hash(password, method='sha256')

   def check_password(self, password):
      return check_password_hash(self.password, password)

   def __repr__(self):
      return '<User {}>'.format(self.username)


class Post(db.Model):
   id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
   title = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
   slug = db.Column(db.String(140), nullable=False)
   body = db.Column(db.Text(), nullable=False)
   created = db.Column(db.DateTime, index=True, default=datetime.now(timezone.utc))
   author = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))

   def __repr__(self):
      return '<Post> {}'.format(self.slug)


@login.user_loader
def load_user(id):
   return User.query.get(int(id))

```

Really the only complicated thing we need to do is modify our routes now. That means removing the data structures that we hardcoded, controlling access, and getting our tests to pass. My first step will be to get data from the database and display one or many posts.

_routes.py_
```python
@app.route('/blog')
@app.route('/blog/<id>')
def blog(id=None):
   title = 'Fancy-Pants Blog'
   if id is None:
      data = Post.query.order_by(created)
   else:
      data = Post.query.filter_by(id=id).first_or_404()
   
   return render_template('blog.html', title=title, data=data)
```

I added another route to this method so that it responds either to retrieve all of the posts or just one depending on whether more than one are requested. Then, instead of having my data hardcoded in my route, I query or retrieve data from the database. Now I need to make a change to my template. 

_blog.html_
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
{% for post in data %}
<div class="blog-post">
   <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2><br>
   <h3>{{ post.slug }}</h3>
   <h3>{{ post.author.first_name }} {{ post.author.last_name }}</h3>
   <p>{{ post.text }}</p>
   <p>{{ post.created }}</p>
</div>
{% endfor %}

{% endblock %}
```

You'll notice that I'm still iterating through the data object because the query will return a list of posts. Also, since I created a relationship between Post and User, I can access the user associated with each post directly. This one view will show a single post or mutliple posts depending on how many items are in the data object. This means I don't need a separate view template for the individual or list view. I might change this later. Perhaps if I'm listing all posts, I just want to show the title, author, and tagline, but these are all design decisions. I'm going to have a problem here, though. When I display the data in a template, the template is going to look for an iterable list. If we think about the data when we get one post the code looks like this: ```data = Post.query.filter_by(id=id).first_or_404()``` This means get all the posts that have this particular id. If there are more than one post with that id (there won't be) we take the first. If there are no posts with that id, the user is routed to the page not found view (404). If the call is successful, then data will be a single object as opposed to a list of objects. There are two solutions: check if data is a list in the template and only iterate if it is, or force the single post into a list. Neither solution is brilliant, but the least amount of code is to just change my route slightly:

_routes.py_
```python
...

@app.route('/blog')
@app.route('/blog/<id>')
def blog(id=None):
   title = 'Fancy-Pants Blog'
   if id is None:
      data = Post.query.order_by('created')
   else:
      data = [Post.query.filter_by(id=id).first_or_404()]
   
   return render_template('blog.html', title=title, data=data)

...
```
Now ```data``` is only ever a list. If there is only one post, then it is a list with a single object in it.

All that's left is for me to get the route setup for the user to enter a post. This is very much like the registration route. Instead of creating a user object and inserting it into the database, I create a post object and insert it into the database.

_routes.py_
```python
@app.route('/post', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@login_required
def new_post():

   form = NewEntryForm()
   if form.validate_on_submit():
      p = Post(
         title = form.post_title.data,
         slug = form.slug.data,
         body = form.text.data,
         author = current_user.id
      )
      db.session.add(p)
      db.session.commit()
      flash('Post Created!')
      return redirect(url_for('blog'))
   return render_template('post.html', form=form)
```

1. ```p = Post(...)``` Again, I create an instance of the Post class. Then I populate it with data.

2. ```author = current_user.id``` This is important. Remember how I said I'd be getting the author automatically? This is how I do it. The current user is set by flask-login. I know this will be set because the route is decorated with ```@login_required``` which means the user must login to even visit this route. All I need to do is get the id from the current_user object. If you're interested, flask-login stores the current_user in the session data, meaning it is retained until the user shuts down their browser, clears their session manually, follows the logout route in the app, or the session expires. 

3. Finally, we add the post and commit the changes to the database. 

Since we have a lot of files by now, here's a link to a github repository that has all of the code we've written: [Blog](https://github.com/dlondonmedina/blog) The config file is not included because it's generally better not to include that publicly because it has secret keys in it and the like. Here is the sample I've been working through here:

_config.py_
```python
import os 

class Config:
   BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'us@randomStrin1her0'
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or \
      'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'app.db')
   SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False 

```

If we run our tests, they will all pass now!

```
(env) ~/Projects/blog$ python -m unittest tests/blog_tests.py

```

There's one last thing that we need to do however, if we want to be able to use the app. We need to setup our database. If you recall, we added flask-migrate and the Migrate() method in our \_\_init\_\_.py script. This allows us to create our databases and tables through our terminal. 

```
(env) ~/Projects/blog$ pip install flask-migrate
# ...
(env) ~/Projects/blog$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
(env) ~/Projects/blog$ flask db init

```

1. ```pip install flask-migrate``` installs flask migrate. Then I update my requirements file. 

2. ```flask db init``` This initializes the database. It does not create tables, but prepares the database for tables.

3. ```flask db migrate -m "users and posts tables"``` This reads from models.py and executes the appropriate SQL commands to create tables that match the models we created. Notice, flask-migrate does database version control, so the ```-m "users and posts tables``` is a message that gets stored with this version of the database. The message is arbitrary, but should be short and descriptive.

4. ```flask db upgrade``` This finally saves the changes that we made in the migration to the database. Think of "migrate" as staging changes and "upgrade" as making those changes permanent, just like git add and git commit. 

If you run these commands a few things to note: a directory called "migrations/" will be created. This is where flask-migrate stores the version control information. Also a file called app.db will be created. This is your database since we are using SQLite. I would recommend adding "migrations/" and "*.db" and "config.py" to your .gitignore file. 

## Conclusion

At this point you should have a fully functional blog. It will be ugly, not have a lot of features, but it is the basics. There are many steps you can take from here. I recommend taking a look at Miguel Grinberg's Course and Book [Flask Web Development](https://courses.miguelgrinberg.com/). He does not take a TDD approach, but he does give you a much more thorough walkthrough of Flask and everything that it can do.
